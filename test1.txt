Waiting for my mom to pick me up from karate, I searched for something to occupy me. My eyes darted around the room like a thunderbolt and were soon drawn to their lightning rod: four letters on the collage of motivational messages on the wall. "CAN I": Constant and Never-Ending Improvement.
I won fourth place in my very first karate tournament. I know what you’re thinking: a true child prodigy! And because child prodigies don’t need to work hard, I didn’t. The next year, unsurprisingly, I didn’t even place. My ego was shattered. For subsequent tournaments, I went through the motions. I made progress through the belts, but karate had become just a sport my parents signed me up for. Every trophy and award just felt empty and undeserved. If I had started at the top of the cosine wave, I was now at the bottom of the trough. Doing karate through a camera during the pandemic left a rain cloud hanging over my head. Losing friends when my old dojo closed made it stormier than ever.
But waves have crests: I would find the eye of the storm. I made new friends and suddenly I didn’t feel alone at the new dojo. When COVID died down, we resumed Wednesday sparring and suddenly I forgot all about the pandemic. I spent countless hours cloistered in the garage, sharpening my kicks, making sure that each one was better than the last. In turn, each kick made me fall back in love just a bit more. 
I've known how to throw a front kick for half my life, but I’ve only recently noticed its beauty. There's so much that goes into a front kick: make contact with the ball of your foot to protect your toes; direct your momentum out - not up; land in a viable stance; chamber and rechamber; and maintain your balance by keeping your center of gravity over your plant foot. Every detail, no matter how minute, contributed to the brilliance of my kick. 
And suddenly, I was in love with karate again.
Snap! Like a thunderclap, I heard the boom of my kick. Kicks are the most beautiful thing in the world. I live to hear that crisp snap, to see my question-mark kick’s arc draw the symbol for the Gamma Function as if the air were a whiteboard, and to feel the wave-like flow of my follow-up after each kick, to experience the pay-off of a decade of dedication. Now, let’s put my kicks to the test - time to spar.
Sparring is the art in “martial arts”, it ebbs and flows. You must transition seamlessly between attacking and defending. I can feel that same rhythm in almost everything I do. The powerful push and pull of the tides in a storm reminds me of the transition between the compact chamber and the explosive extension of a spinning back kick. When I sit down at my computer to simulate fluid dynamics by approximating the Navier-Stokes equation with finite differences, the back-and-forth of the fluid on my screen sends me to the back-and-forth exchange with my partner last Wednesday. The phase plane solution to a system of differential equations cycles like the continuous flow of my sparring match.
It’s amazing the things you can do with a growth mindset and an unadulterated love for a sport. Since dispelling the rain cloud over my head, I’ve won numerous trophies and even a katana and earned my black belt. 
In my head, every kick, sparring match, and garage practice session swirls around like a thundering and ceaseless hurricane. Each flash of lightning ignites another spark. Each spark propels the next step. Each step sets me farther along my journey of Constant and Never-Ending Journey. I’ll trudge forward, not as a child prodigy but as a curious student, ready to grow.

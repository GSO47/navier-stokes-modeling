text = """  I hope you are well. I checked my AP score: I eeked out a 5! The test was easy compared to what we covered for your class. 
            Though my score for the last test of the year was crummy (Vivian still beat me :( ), I still survived the AP test.

            I am grateful for how you taught chemistry. Your class was amid my favorites this year!
            
            Also, tell Charlie I say hi!

            PS Count how many Cs, Hs and Ns were I are in this email so far (not incuding this line and the initial "Hi Ms. Moshiri")

            Thank you for a great year,
            Gautham
